This was not my first intro to python programming so to me it was kind of slow to start, but for someone actually brand new I could see it being a good pace but i do feel like wayyyyyyy to much emphasis was put on string splicing and print formatting, we spent like 6 classes on that alone and then like 2 classes on OOP, so I think the learning curve kind of spiked wildly up for others. But the professor gave an insane amount of extra credit from this course so much so that if  scored anything less then a 108 it brought my grade down, so getting a perfect 100 on an assignment that didn't have extra credit actually brought my grade down lol. This was a good class though especially as an intro. Final Grade: TBD (107.69% currently)
