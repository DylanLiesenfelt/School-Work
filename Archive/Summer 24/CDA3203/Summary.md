This was not the most ideal course, professor seems to be new to teaching, the course was very disorganized, I cant say I really learned anything from this class directly, because everything I learned was either on my own or carried over from COT2000. I do like the subject matter, but it did feel like some of the course content drove to far off course for the use of someone getting a CS degree this definitely more geared towards someone getting a CE degree. Final Grade: TBD (A)
